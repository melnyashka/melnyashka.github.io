That's a description of the guided tour I had a pleasure to take part in to Chernobyl and Pripyat (see Wikipedia). I like to read travel notes of that kind, so there is my small contribution to the World Wide Web. So guys, yesterday I was in The Zone. And I feel like writing a small step-by-step report about that. Zalissia Well, almost 90% of time spent in The Zone was spent, actually, in a bus driving through cheerful green forests. So, when we stopped at the Zalissia village, 90% of time we were walking through the forest, as the nature seems to have taken this land by force. Whatever remained from people are some fences, half-destroyed huts with rotten roofs and dense wine smell from a thick carpet of ripe apples crunching under your feet. You are even kind of allowed to eat them, but in fact you are not, just in the case. Despite the fact that Zalissa is located in the alienation zone, it was almost uncontaminated during the accident, and people were asked to leave this place rather because of some political reasons, not because it was absolutely necessary. Anyway, not all of them has left the village. We have visited an old lady Rozalia Ivanovna, former literature teacher, currently residing in Zalissia in absolute loneliness. She provided our group with some supplies: we got few plastic bags of plums, apples and pears, as it was heartbreaking for her to let all those things rot. Anyway, we were not that sentimental and finally let it rot closer to the road, again, just in the case. Duga-1 Red Forest Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Reactors Pripyat, Chernobyl" />
