<meta name="description" content="I was born on 28 February 1994 in Kiev (Ukraine). Long story short (check CV), now I am doing my PhD between two research labs: AGM (UMR CNRS 8088) and LJK (UMR CNRS 5224), supervised by Eva Löcherbach (University of Cergy-Pontoise) and Adeline Leclercq-Samson (University of Grenoble Alpes). Main subject of my thesis is statistics for stochastic processes with degenerate noise and their application to neuroscience. More precisely, I am dealing with parametric inference, approximation schemes and hypothesis testing. More formal introduction to what am I doing will be posted in Research (as soon as I find out how to deal with TeX and Rmd plugins). Currently I am kindly accomodated by LJK lab. After I have finished my Master's internship there, I found it absolutely heartbreaking to leave magnificent alpine landscapes (and alpine ski resorts!), and asked my supervisors to extend my stay in Grenoble. If you need to contact me for some reason, please check Contacts. In my free time I do nearly all types of outdoor activities (i.e. hiking, riding a bike, climbing, swimming, skiing) and also read almost everything, starting from German philosophy and Scandinavian myths and ending with civil defence tutorials and all kinds of survival-related literature. Some stuff related to my non-research interests will be lately gathered in Random. Sincere gratitude is expressed to creators of Pelican, who made the development of this webpage possible even for such a lazy person like me, and also to Alexandro Vicenzi for creating a theme Flex, which is used here in a slightly modified way." />
